This is my lab00 README.md

This shell script takes in a file name, and sees if that file exists already. If it does, it empties the file. If not, it creates a new file with the given name.

The program then searches the director of the file, and adds each file name in said directory to the created file.

Then the program prints out the created file's contents.
